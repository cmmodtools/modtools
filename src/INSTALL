macOS users that want to use the prebuilt binaries may see an error stating
that the application "canâ€™t be opened because it is from an unidentified
developer".

To resolve this the "xattr -cr" command must be run on the application from the
Terminal. The Terminal app can be opened from Finder Go->Utilities->Terminal or
Spotlight search Terminal. Once Terminal is open, run "xattr -cr" appending the
location of the application (without quotes).

In most cases it is sufficient to simply copy and paste the following command
into the Terminal:

        xattr -cr ~/Downloads/mac_modtools*

To install the rezexplode/rezpack commands on your system, copy and paste the
following command into the Terminal:

        xattr -cr ~/Downloads/mac_modtools*
	unzip ~/Downloads/mac_modtools*
	cd mac_modtools*
	sudo install -d /usr/local/bin
	sudo install rezexplode rezpack /usr/local/bin

COMPILING

Under macOS the command line Xcode tools must be installed. Then rezexplode and
rezpack can be built with:

	tar zxvf modtools-src*
	cd src
	make
	sudo make install

The build commands are very similar for Linux:

	tar zxvf modtools-src*
	cd src
	make CFLAGS="-Wall -O2 -D_GNU_SOURCE"
	sudo make install
